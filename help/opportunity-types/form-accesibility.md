Forms Accessibility opportunities are critical for enhancing user interactions and increasing conversions. Evaluating your forms for compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) helps ensure an inclusive experience for users with visual, auditory, cognitive, and motor impairments. This not only fulfills ethical and legal requirements but also improves form completion rates and broadens your audience, resulting in a better user experience and stronger business outcomes.
