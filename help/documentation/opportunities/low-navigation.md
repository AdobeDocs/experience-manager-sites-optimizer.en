The low navigation opportunity identifies forms on your website that have low navigation rates. This opportunity helps you understand which forms are not being discovered or accessed by users and provides suggestions on how to improve their discoverability. By optimizing navigation to your forms, you can increase the number of form interactions and improve the overall performance of your website.

## Auto-identify
