To help fix this problem, the broken internal links opportunity points out broken URL's and provides suggestions for valid link updates. Addressing these issues will improve user engagement and ensure smooth navigation and accessibility.

The broken internal links opportunity displays a summary at the top of the page, including a synopsis of the problem and its impact on your site and business.
