To help fix this problem, the broken internal links opportunity points out broken URLs and provides suggestions for valid link updates. Addressing these issues will improve user engagement and ensure smooth navigation and accessibility.

The broken internal links opportunity displays a summary at the top of the page, including a synopsis of the problem and its impact on your site and business.

Select the **information** icon to view the AI rationale for the suggested URL. The rationale explains why the AI believes the suggested URL is the best fit for the broken link. This can help you understand the AI's decision-making process and make an informed decision on whether to accept or reject the suggestion.

<!--![Edit suggested URL of broken internal links](./assets/broken-internal-links/edit-target-url.png){align="center"}-->

The edit window contains the **Broken target path** of the link, the **Desired target path** where you can manually edit the link and a field with the Ai-generated suggestion. After you are done editing, click **Save** to update the broken link entry. A yellow dot will appear in the entry field to indicate that the link has been edited.
