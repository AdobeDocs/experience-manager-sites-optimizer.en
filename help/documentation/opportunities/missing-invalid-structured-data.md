The missing or invalid structured data opportunity identifies missing or faulty structured data in the Json-LD standardized format. Structured data is a way to organize, describe and label important information on your website. It helps search engines interpret the content of your pages and it leads to improved visibility in search results. Better search results can lead to more users engaging with your website.

The missing or invalid structured data opportunity displays a summary at the top of the page, including a synopsis of the problem and its impact on your site and business.

* **Projected traffic lost** – The estimated traffic loss due to faulty structured data.
* **Projected traffic value** – The estimated value of the lost traffic.
