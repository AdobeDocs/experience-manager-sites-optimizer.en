# Invalid or missing metadata opportunity

![Invalid or missing metadata opportunity](./assets/missing-or-invalid-metadata/hero.png)

The invalid or missing metadata opportunity identifies missing or faulty metadata on your web pages. Fixing metadata issues boosts SEO by improving content visibility,search rankings, and user engagement. These issues can arise from factors like missing or invalid tags, descriptions that are too long or too short and so on.

The invalid or missing metadata opportunity displays a summary at the top of the page, including a synopsis of the problem and its impact on your site and business.

* **Projected traffic lost** – The estimated traffic loss due to faulty metadata.
* **Projected traffic value** – The estimated value of the lost traffic.

## Auto-identify

* **Issue** – Indicates the type of issue impacting the metadata tag. These can range from missing titles to duplicate H1's and so on.
